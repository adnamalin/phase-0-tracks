# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is... controlling versions! It's a way to organize changes and keep everything clean and understandable. It's useful to understand how the versions change and evolve, and also it helps keep things organized.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Separate branches are necessary because you don't want to work in the master branch! Git branches are different offshoots of the master branch where one or multiple users can concurrently change different things in the files the branch contains. It can then be re-integrated back into the master branch later.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
After you've saved the file (which was a very simple step that I wasn't understanding for a long time!) you can commit in the terminal. The terminal then applies this version as the current, working version. You can go back in time to prior commits in case the one you're working on isn't as you'd like. A good commit message is a succinct and descriptive one, and in present tense.


* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when you try to merge branches and Git doesn't know which change to implement. If two lines of the same document have been altered in different branches, or if they have been deleted altogether, Git doesn't know which to prioritize.

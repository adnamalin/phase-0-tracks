# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to manage revision history to a file or multiple files over time and allow merging of versions between different people. It is useful in coding to manage your projects as you build them and work with other developers. It gives you a system to organize projects which can get large in scale.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of your project that you can create within it. Typically you have a master branch that is the final version so want to create branches off of it to test new code out before finalizing it. You would create a new branch to develop, update, and experiment with before deciding it will be a part of the project. If you decide you want to include it then you can merge the branch to your master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in your project that you make often to keep your files updated and current. You make a commit when you have changed or updated your project and you should make them frequently. A good commit message will be meaningful and clear about what you did to the project.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when you attempt to merge two different branches that have a different version of the same file. Git does not know which version on this file you want to keep so it will report a conflict that you have to fix. You can open said file and Git will notate it and you can see the two different version contents and you'll have to edit it to the version you intended to merge.

  <!--HTML5 semantic tags give meaning to the content. It sections it off from other parts.
I'm not sure if I understand this question correctly, but the browser will show elements in the order that they are written (unless it is in the head, a comment, or overridden by CSS or by some other method I don't yet know about.)
In this challenge, I learned that sublime can help you create shortcuts. You can store text you'll use repetitively as a snippet! Snippets were fun, and I do hope to use them in the future when I'm creating a page that calls for their use.
The variables in this challenge were hardest for me to comprehend, but my partner and I experimented until we understood it. I'm sure it will come in handy!

    <h2>Thai Cooking</h2>
    <p>I'm learning to cook Thai food, and I'm really excited about it! A lot of the ingredients and cooking techniques are pretty different from western cooking (which, in itself, derives a lot from French cooking techniques.) I look forward to sharing my progress with you.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <h3>Finding Thai Ingredients</h3>
    <p>First thing's first, you'll want to find a good Asian grocery that stocks Thai products. You can also purchase most things you'll need <a href="http://www.templeofthai.com/food/">online</a>, but it will be significantly more expensive.</p>

    <p>I know you want to eat this curry. It's delicious.</p>
    <img src="Thai/Papaya.jpg" alt="Papaya Salad"/>
    <p>This papaya salad is just as tasty and is a lot easier to make, though. Let's start with that. You'll need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tblsp dried shrimp</li>
        <li>1 ounce palm sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>1 small lime</li>
        <li>1 peeled medium garlic glove</li>
        <li>2 fresh stemmed Thai chiles, more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ounce long beans</li>
        <li>1 tblsp lime juice (preferably from key limes)</li>
        <li>1 tblsp Thai fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tblsp tamarind water (see below!)</li>
        <li>4 ounces peeled and shredded green papaya</li>
        <li>6 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>2 tblsp coarsely chopped roasted unsalted peanuts</li>
        <li>1 cabbage wedge</li>
      </ul>
    <p><em>(Recipe from Andy Ricker in Pok Pok.) You can easily make this vegetarian/vegan by omitting the shrimp and replacing the fish sauce with mushroom sauce.</em></p>
    <p>You'll also probably want to have the following equipment:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>mandoline</li>
          <li>Thai clay mortar</li>
          <li>wooden pestle</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Want to know how to assemble it?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat small shrimp in wok over high heat, stirring constantly, 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Put palm sugarin microwaveable bowl and cover with plastic wrap, and microwave about 10 seconds until softened.</li>
            <li>Pound mixture in a mortar until it makes a smooth paste</li>
            <li>Cut lime lengthwise into 6ths, set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine garlic, chiles, and 1 tblsp softened palm sugar into morat and pound until it's broken down a little, about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add 3 lime wedges and pound them lightly, then add shrimp. Don't smash them.</li>
            <li>Add the long beans, and pound lightly to bruise them.</li>
            <li>Add lime juice, fish sauce, tamarind water, and papaya to mortar. Pound lightly at an angle for about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Toss with a spoon, and add tomatoes and peanuts. Pound lightly.</li>
            <li>Transfer to plate. You're done!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are four regional cuisines (and each region has their own take on papaya salad, as well as plenty of other dishes). The regions and their preferred ingredients and/or flavor profiles follow:</p>

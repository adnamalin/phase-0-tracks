    <h1>Thai Cooking</h1>
    <p>I'm learning to cook Thai food, and I'm really excited about it! A lot of the ingredients and cooking techniques are pretty different from western cooking (which, in itself, derives a lot from French cooking techniques.) I look forward to sharing my progress and discoveries with you.</p>

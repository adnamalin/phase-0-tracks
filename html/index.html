    <h2>Thai Cooking</h2>
    <p>I'm learning to cook Thai food, and I'm really excited about it! A lot of the ingredients and cooking techniques are pretty different from western cooking. I look forward to sharing my progress with you.</p>
    <h3>Finding Thai Ingredients</h3>
    <p>First thing's first, you'll want to find a good Asian grocery that stocks Thai products. You can also purchase most things you'll need <a href="http://www.templeofthai.com/food/">online</a>, but it will be significantly more expensive.</p>

    <p>I know you want to eat this curry. It's delicious.</p>

      <p>This papaya salad is just as tasty and is a lot easier to make, though. Let's start with that. You'll need:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1 tblsp dried shrimp</li>
            <li>1 ounce palm sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon water</li>
            <li>1 small lime</li>
            <li>1 peeled medium garlic glove</li>
            <li>2 fresh stemmed Thai chiles, more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ounce long beans</li>
            <li>1 tblsp lime juice (preferably from key limes)</li>
            <li>1 tblsp Thai fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tblsp tamarind water (<a href="tamarind.html">recipe here!</a>)</li>
            <li>4 ounces peeled and shredded green papaya</li>
            <li>6 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>2 tblsp coarsely chopped roasted unsalted peanuts</li>
            <li>1 cabbage wedge</li>
          </ul>
        <p>(Recipe from Andy Ricker in his book <em>Pok Pok</em>.) You can easily make this vegetarian/vegan by omitting the shrimp and replacing the fish sauce with mushroom sauce.</p>
        <p>You'll also probably want to have the following equipment:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>mandoline</li>
              <li>Thai clay mortar</li>
              <li>wooden pestle</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Want to know how to assemble it?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat small shrimp in wok over high heat, stirring constantly, 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Put palm sugar in microwaveable bowl and cover with plastic wrap, and microwave about 10 seconds until softened.</li>
                <li>Pound mixture in a mortar until it makes a smooth paste</li>
                <li>Cut lime lengthwise into 6ths, set aside.</li>
                <li>Combine garlic, chiles, and 1 tblsp softened palm sugar into morat and pound until it's broken down a little, about 10 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add 3 lime wedges and pound them lightly, then add shrimp. Don't smash them.</li>
                <li>Add the long beans, and pound lightly to bruise them.</li>
                <li>Add lime juice, fish sauce, tamarind water, and papaya to mortar. Pound lightly at an angle for about 10 seconds.</li>
                <li>Toss with a spoon, and add tomatoes and peanuts. Pound lightly.</li>
                <li>Transfer to plate. You're done!</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
         <p>There are four regional cuisines (and each region has their own take on papaya salad, as well as plenty of other dishes). The regions and their preferred ingredients and/or flavor profiles follow:</p>
        <div id="table">
          <table border=1>
              <tr>
                <th>Northern</th>

  <div>If you'd like to know more, a great resource is <a href="http://hot-thai-kitchen.com/">Hot Thai Kitchen</a>. It's set up in a way that's very easy to understand. The HTML starts with a couple of divs, separating sections at the top of the page (but still in the body). After that, there is a lot of linking to other languages, like JavaScript and jQuery. There's no footer here. I also see an iframe declaration. I'm not quite sure what that does, but it looks like it creates a frame which the rest of the website sits inside. Overall, this site has a very pleasing, easy-to-follow design in pleasant colors.</div>

<!--
  1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

  - Semantic tags help make the code more readable to accessbility readers onlien and other coders. It gives meaning to the content organization. I think header, footer, nav are very userful and clear on their use. I also think the section tag is common as well.

  2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

  - Elements are displayed in the order they are written in the html file. When you bring in CSS you can use styling to change elemtns order without changing the html file.


  3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

  - I learned how to create snippets which is useful later on for things like a blog template. I think I will but since I use atom I'll have to learn how to do it on atom.

  4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

  - I think just becomign mroe familiar with semantic tags and their appropriate uses.

    <h2>Thai Cooking</h2>
    <p>I'm learning to cook Thai food, and I'm really excited about it! A lot of the ingredients and cooking techniques are pretty different from western cooking (which, in itself, derives a lot from French cooking techniques.) I look forward to sharing my progress with you.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <h3>Finding Thai Ingredients</h3>
    <p>First thing's first, you'll want to find a good Asian grocery that stocks Thai products. You can also purchase most things you'll need <a href="http://www.templeofthai.com/food/">online</a>, but it will be significantly more expensive.</p>

    <p>I know you want to eat this curry. It's delicious.</p>
    <img src="Thai/Papaya.jpg" alt="Papaya Salad"/>
    <p>This papaya salad is just as tasty and is a lot easier to make, though. Let's start with that. You'll need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tblsp dried shrimp</li>
        <li>1 ounce palm sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>1 small lime</li>
        <li>1 peeled medium garlic glove</li>
        <li>2 fresh stemmed Thai chiles, more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ounce long beans</li>
        <li>1 tblsp lime juice (preferably from key limes)</li>
        <li>1 tblsp Thai fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tblsp tamarind water (see below!)</li>
        <li>4 ounces peeled and shredded green papaya</li>
        <li>6 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>2 tblsp coarsely chopped roasted unsalted peanuts</li>
        <li>1 cabbage wedge</li>
      </ul>

    <p>You'll also probably want to have the following equipment:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>mandoline</li>
          <li>Thai clay mortar</li>
          <li>wooden pestle</li>
      </ol>

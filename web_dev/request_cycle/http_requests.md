**What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?**
Get is used to retrieve information, it has no effect on the data other then to retrieve it. Post is used to send data to the server (customer info, file upload, etc) using HTML forms.

**Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?**

Cookies are small files that store data on your computer about you created by websites to gather information about you and your preferences. Cookies originally stored the data onto your computer directly but since the amount of data stores is pushing the size capacity of cookies a more popular method is to store identifier information on the cookie and the actually data on the website servers. that way the website just needs to know your ID from the cookie on your computer to look up the data on their own servers.

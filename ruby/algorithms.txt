Decide when floor you would like to go to.
If given up or down option, Approach elevator and press up button if the floor you want is above you. (more than current floor.)
Press down button if the floor you want is below you. (less than current floor.)
When elevator doors open, enter elevator. 
Press button of the floor you want to go to (how do we decide this?)

If your floor number is lighted, get off. If not, wait until the floor number you pressed is lit and exit elevator.
